NSMutableArrayExplorer
======================

This is a companion repo for my [blog post on internals of NSMutableArray](http://ciechanowski.me/blog/2014/03/05/exposing-nsmutablearray/). 

The Xcode project investigates the internal data structures of `NSMutableArray` printing their contents to the console.

##Requirements

- iOS 7.0 device

##Important

This project might break in the future, it works as of iOS 7.0 SDK.

The sole purpose of this application is to `NSLog` stuff. It doesn't display anything on the screen.
